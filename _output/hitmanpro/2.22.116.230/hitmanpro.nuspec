    <summary>HitmanPro is a second opinion scanner, designed to rescue your computer from malware (viruses, trojans, rootkits, etc.) that have infected your computer despite all the security measures you have taken (such as anti virus software, firewalls, etc.).</summary>
    <description> Hitman Pro 3 can scan a computer in only a few minutes from a USB Flash Drive, CD/DVD, local or network attached hard drive and will quickly reveal the presence of any malware using a Behavioral Scan. The actual verification of these potential malware files is then done on the Hitman Pro servers, the "Scan Cloud", which incorporates a hosted multi-vendor scanning service. Hitman Pro 3 uses 7 different anti virus programs to analyze the suspicious files.

Hitman Pro 3 can be used in addition to your existing anti virus program. Scanning your PC is free so Hitman Pro 3 is an ideal solution to check if your current anti virus program is protecting you sufficiently.

Software is a trial but you can perform one time scans indefinitely.
